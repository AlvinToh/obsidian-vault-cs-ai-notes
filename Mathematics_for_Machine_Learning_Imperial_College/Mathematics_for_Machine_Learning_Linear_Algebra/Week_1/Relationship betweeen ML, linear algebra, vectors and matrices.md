Suppose you have an distribution describing the variation of heights . 
Center of the distribution -> mu
How wide it is -> sigma

 f(x), some function of x where x is the height, 
= 1 over sigma root 2 pi times the exponential of - (x - mu) squared divided by 2 sigma squared

The area of a distribution is 1
The above is described as a Gaussian Distribution

Fitting this distribution refers to finding the best possible mu and sigma
We will plot out mu and sigma over a 2d axis and to plot the chages while finding the best possible mu and sigma

We can use vectors to plot towards the best possible fitting mu and sigma, through using other possible combinations of vectors

Suppose a car can be plotted in vectors
We can write down its parameter in a vector
```[
	cost in euros
	emission performance in grams of CO2
	nox performance
	Euro NCAP Star rating
	top speed 	 
	]
```

* Moving at right angles to contour lines in the parameter space will have the greatest effect on the fit than moving in other directions.

 Associative vector addition does not care what order it comes with
* s + r = r + s
* (r + s) + t = r + (s + t)
